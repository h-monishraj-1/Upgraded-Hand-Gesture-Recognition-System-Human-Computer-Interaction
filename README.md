# Upgraded-Hand-Gesture-Recognition-System-Human-Computer-Interaction
This project uses a webcam, MediaPipe, TensorFlow, and OpenCV to recognize hand gestures, enhancing human-computer interaction for individuals with disabilities. It detects hand landmarks, classifies gestures, and translates them into commands for an intuitive interface.

One key innovative factor of this project is the ability to upload images and detect hand gestures from it.

# Requirements
• mediapipe 0.10.14 <br>
• OpenCV 4.10.0.82 or later <br>
• Tensorflow  2.16.1 or later <br>
• scikit-learn  1.5.0 <br>
• matplotlib  3.9.0 <br>
