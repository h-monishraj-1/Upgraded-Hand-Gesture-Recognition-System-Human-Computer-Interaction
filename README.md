# Upgraded-Hand-Gesture-Recognition-System-Human-Computer-Interaction
This project uses a webcam, MediaPipe, TensorFlow, and OpenCV to recognize hand gestures, enhancing human-computer interaction for individuals with disabilities. It detects hand landmarks, classifies gestures, and translates them into commands for an intuitive interface.
